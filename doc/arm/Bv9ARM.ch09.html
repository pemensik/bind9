    <p>
      BIND 9.12.0 is a new feature release of BIND, still under development.
      This document summarizes new features and functional changes that
      have been introduced on this branch.  With each development
      release leading up to the final BIND 9.12.0 release, this document
      will be updated with additional features added and bugs fixed.

    <p>
      The latest versions of BIND 9 software can always be found at
      <a class="link" href="http://www.isc.org/downloads/" target="_top">http://www.isc.org/downloads/</a>.
      There you will find additional information about each release,
      source code, and pre-compiled versions for Microsoft Windows
      operating systems.

<a name="relnotes_license"></a>License Change</h3></div></div></div>
    <p>
      With the release of BIND 9.11.0, ISC changed to the open
      source license for BIND from the ISC license to the Mozilla
      Public License (MPL 2.0).
    </p>
    <p>
      The MPL-2.0 license requires that if you make changes to
      licensed software (e.g. BIND) and distribute them outside
      your organization, that you publish those changes under that
      same license. It does not require that you publish or disclose
      anything other than the changes you made to our software.
    </p>
    <p>
      This requirement will not affect anyone who is using BIND
      without redistributing it, nor anyone redistributing it without
      changes, therefore this change will be without consequence
      for most individuals and organizations who are using BIND.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those unsure whether or not the license change affects their
      use of BIND, or who wish to discuss how to comply with the
      license may contact ISC at <a class="link" href="https://www.isc.org/mission/contact/" target="_top">
      https://www.isc.org/mission/contact/</a>.

    <p>
      As of BIND 9.11.2, Windows XP is no longer a supported platform for
      BIND, and Windows XP binaries are no longer available for download
      from ISC.

	      In place of the acache, <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> can now use

	      delegation responses.  Unlike acache, this feature is on by

	      The <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> query logic implemented in
	      <span class="command"><strong>query_find()</strong></span> has been split into
	      smaller functions with a context structure to maintain state
	      between them, and extensive comments have been added.
	      [RT #43929]
	    </p>

<li class="listitem">
	    <p>
	      Similarly the iterative query logic implemented in
	      <span class="command"><strong>resquery_response()</strong></span> function has been
	      split into smaller functions and comments added. [RT #45362]
	    </p>

<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  Code implementing name server query processing has been moved
	  from <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> to an external library,
	  <span class="command"><strong>libns</strong></span>. This will make it easier to
	  write unit tests for the code, or to link it into new tools.
	  [RT #45186]

<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> can now synthesize negative responses
	  (NXDOMAIN, NODATA, or wildcard answers) from cached DNSSEC-verified
	  records that were returned in negative or wildcard responses from
	  authoritative servers.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This will reduce query loads on authoritative servers for signed
	  domains: when existing cached records can be used by the resolver
	  to determine that a name does not exist in the authorittive domain,
	  no query needs to be sent. Reducing the number of iterative queries
	  should also improve resolver performance.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This behavior is controlled by the new
	  <code class="filename">named.conf</code> option
	  <span class="command"><strong>synth-from-dnssec</strong></span>.  It is enabled by
	  default.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Note: this currently only works for zones signed using NSEC.
	  Support for zones signed using NSEC3 (without opt-out) is
	  planned for the future.

	  When acting as a recursive resolver, <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span>
	  can now continue returning answers whose TTLs have expired
	  when the authoritative server is under attack and unable to
	  respond. This is controlled by the
	  <span class="command"><strong>stale-answer-enable</strong></span>,
	  <span class="command"><strong>stale-answer-ttl</strong></span> and

	  The DNS Response Policy Service (DNSRPS) API, a mechanism to
	  allow <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> to use an external response policy
	  provider, is now supported. (One example of such a provider is
	  "FastRPZ" from Farsight Security, Inc.) This allows the same
	  types of policy filtering as standard RPZ, but can reduce the
	  workload for <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span>, particularly when using
	  large and frequently-updated policy zones. It also enables
	  <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> to share response policy providers
	  with other DNS implementations such as Unbound.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This feature is avaiable if BIND is built with
	  <span class="command"><strong>configure --enable-dnsrps</strong></span>, if a DNSRPS
	  provider is installed, and if <span class="command"><strong>dnsrps-enable</strong></span>
	  is set to "yes" in <code class="filename">named.conf</code>. Standard
	  built-in RPZ is used otherwise.

	  and reliability when policy zones receive frequent updates.
