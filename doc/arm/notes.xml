      BIND 9.12.0 is a new feature release of BIND, still under development.
      This document summarizes new features and functional changes that
      have been introduced on this branch.  With each development
      release leading up to the final BIND 9.12.0 release, this document
      will be updated with additional features added and bugs fixed.

  <section xml:id="relnotes_license"><info><title>License Change</title></info>
    <para>
      With the release of BIND 9.11.0, ISC changed to the open
      source license for BIND from the ISC license to the Mozilla
      Public License (MPL 2.0).
    </para>
    <para>
      The MPL-2.0 license requires that if you make changes to
      licensed software (e.g. BIND) and distribute them outside
      your organization, that you publish those changes under that
      same license. It does not require that you publish or disclose
      anything other than the changes you made to our software.
    </para>
    <para>
      This requirement will not affect anyone who is using BIND
      without redistributing it, nor anyone redistributing it without
      changes, therefore this change will be without consequence
      for most individuals and organizations who are using BIND.
    </para>
    <para>
      Those unsure whether or not the license change affects their
      use of BIND, or who wish to discuss how to comply with the
      license may contact ISC at <link
      xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

	<para>
	  Many aspects of <command>named</command> have been modified
	  to improve query performance, and in particular, performance
	  for delegation-heavy zones:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The additional cache ("acache") was found not to
	      significantly improve performance and has been removed;
	      the <command>acache-enable</command> and
	      <command>acache-cleaning-interval</command> options are now
	      deprecated.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      In place of the acache, <command>named</command> can now use
	      a glue cache to speed up retrieval of glue records when sending
	      delegation responses.  Unlike acache, this feature is on by
	      default; use <command>glue-cache no;</command> to disable it.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The <command>additional-from-cache</command>
	      and <command>additional-from-auth</command> options have been
	      deprecated.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      <command>minimal-responses</command> is now set
	      to <literal>yes</literal> by default.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Several functions have been refactored to improve
	      performance, including name compression, owner name
	      case restoration, hashing, and buffers.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Several areas of code have been refactored for improved
	  readability, maintainability, and testability:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The <command>named</command> query logic implemented in
	      <command>query_find()</command> has been split into
	      smaller functions with a context structure to maintain state
	      between them, and extensive comments have been added.
	      [RT #43929]
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Similarly the iterative query logic implemented in
	      <command>resquery_response()</command> function has been
	      split into smaller functions and comments added. [RT #45362]
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Code implementing name server query processing has been moved
	  from <command>named</command> to an external library,
	  <command>libns</command>. This will make it easier to
	  write unit tests for the code, or to link it into new tools.
	  [RT #45186]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>named</command> can now synthesize negative responses
	  (NXDOMAIN, NODATA, or wildcard answers) from cached DNSSEC-verified
	  records that were returned in negative or wildcard responses from
	  authoritative servers.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This will reduce query loads on authoritative servers for signed
	  domains: when existing cached records can be used by the resolver
	  to determine that a name does not exist in the authorittive domain,
	  no query needs to be sent. Reducing the number of iterative queries
	  should also improve resolver performance.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This behavior is controlled by the new
	  <filename>named.conf</filename> option
	  <command>synth-from-dnssec</command>.  It is enabled by
	  default.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Note: this currently only works for zones signed using NSEC.
	  Support for zones signed using NSEC3 (without opt-out) is
	  planned for the future.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Thanks to APNIC for sponsoring this work.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  When acting as a recursive resolver, <command>named</command>
	  can now continue returning answers whose TTLs have expired
	  when the authoritative server is under attack and unable to
	  respond. This is controlled by the
	  <command>stale-answer-enable</command>,
	  <command>stale-answer-ttl</command> and
	  <command>max-stale-ttl</command> options. [RT #44790]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The DNS Response Policy Service (DNSRPS) API, a mechanism to
	  allow <command>named</command> to use an external response policy
	  provider, is now supported. (One example of such a provider is
	  "FastRPZ" from Farsight Security, Inc.) This allows the same
	  types of policy filtering as standard RPZ, but can reduce the
	  workload for <command>named</command>, particularly when using
	  large and frequently-updated policy zones. It also enables
	  <command>named</command> to share response policy providers
	  with other DNS implementations such as Unbound.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This feature is avaiable if BIND is built with
	  <command>configure --enable-dnsrps</command>, if a DNSRPS
	  provider is installed, and if <command>dnsrps-enable</command>
	  is set to "yes" in <filename>named.conf</filename>. Standard
	  built-in RPZ is used otherwise.
	</para>
	<para>

	  contribution. [RT #43376]

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Setting <command>max-journal-size</command> to
	  <literal>default</literal> limits journal sizes to twice the
	  size of the zone contents.  This can be overridden by setting
	  <command>max-journal-size</command> to <literal>unlimited</literal>
	  or to an explicit value up to 2G. Thanks to Tony Finch for
	  the contribution. [RT #38324]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>dnstap</command> logfiles can now be configured to
	  automatically roll when they reach a specified size. If
	  <command>dnstap-output</command> is configured with mode
	  <literal>file</literal>, then it can take optional
	  <command>size</command> and <command>versions</command>
	  key-value arguments to set the logfile rolling parameters.
	  (These have the same semantics as the corresponding
	  options in a <command>logging</command> channel statement.)
	  [RT #44502]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Logging channels and <command>dnstap-output</command> files can
	  now be configured with a <command>suffix</command> option,
	  set to either <literal>increment</literal> or
	  <literal>timestamp</literal>, indicating whether log files
	  should be given incrementing suffixes when they roll
	  over (e.g., <filename>logfile.0</filename>,
	  <filename>.1</filename>, <filename>.2</filename>, etc)
	  or suffixes indicating the time of the roll. The default
	  is <literal>increment</literal>.  [RT #42838]

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The <command>print-time</command> option in the
	  <command>logging</command> configuration can now take arguments
	  <userinput>local</userinput>, <userinput>iso8601</userinput> or
	  <userinput>iso8601-utc</userinput> to indicate the format in
	  which the date and time should be logged. For backward
	  compatibility, <userinput>yes</userinput> is a synonym for
	  <userinput>local</userinput>.  [RT #42585]

	<para>
	  The new <command>dnssec-cds</command> command generates a new DS
	  set to place in a parent zone, based on the contents of a child
	  zone's validated CDS or CDNSKEY records. It can produce a
	  <filename>dsset</filename> file suitable for input to
	  <command>dnssec-signzone</command>, or a series of
	  <command>nsupdate</command> to update the parent zone via dynamic
	  DNS. Thanks to Tony Finch for the contribution.  [RT #46090]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>nsupdate</command> and <command>rndc</command> now accepts

	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>nsec3hash -r</command> ("rdata order") takes arguments
	  in the same order as they appear in NSEC3 or NSEC3PARAM records.

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>rndc</command> commands which refer to zone names
	  can now reference a zone of type <command>redirect</command>
	  by using the special zone name "-redirect". (Previously this
	  was not possible because <command>redirect</command> zones
	  always have the name ".", which can be ambiguous.)
	</para>
	<para>
	  In the event you need to manipulate a zone actually
	  called "-redirect", use a trailing dot: "-redirect."

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  By default, BIND now uses the random number generation functions
	  in the cryptographic library (i.e., OpenSSL or a PKCS#11
	  provider) as a source of high-quality randomness rather than
	  <filename>/dev/random</filename>.  This is suitable for virtual
	  machine environments, which may have limited entropy pools and
	  lack hardware random number generators.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This can be overridden by specifying another entropy source via
	  the <command>random-device</command> option in
	  <filename>named.conf</filename>, or via the <command>-r</command>
	  command line option.  However, for functions requiring full
	  cryptographic strength, such as DNSSEC key generation, this
	  <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> be overridden. In particular, the
	  <command>-r</command> command line option no longer has any
	  effect on <command>dnssec-keygen</command>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This can be disabled by building with
	  <command>configure --disable-crypto-rand</command>, in which
	  case <filename>/dev/random</filename> will be the default
	  entropy source.  [RT #31459] [RT #46047]

	  key maintenance just as if the server was being started for
	  the first time.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This is intended for testing purposes, but can be used -- with
	  extreme caution -- as a brute-force repair for unrecoverable

	  Fixed a bug that was introduced in an earlier development
	  release which caused multi-packet AXFR and IXFR messages to fail
	  validation if not all packets contained TSIG records; this
	  caused interoperability problems with some other DNS
	  implementations. [RT #45509]

	  Multiple <command>cookie-secret</command> clauses are now
	  supported.  The first <command>cookie-secret</command> in
	  <filename>named.conf</filename> is used to generate new
	  server cookies.  Any others are used to accept old server
	  cookies or those generated by other servers using the
	  matching <command>cookie-secret</command>.

	  The <command>dnssec-signzone -x</command> flag and the
